Empty roads, empty trains, and that rare feeling of a car-free city. There’s less stress searching for an open coffee shop—because, let’s face it, McDonald’s is often the only place open around here. 😅</p>
<p>Lately, we’ve made it a tradition as a family to do the Sunday McDonald’s run, treating ourselves to their “new” Iced Caramel Latte. But here’s the thing: I never bothered collecting loyalty points. Honestly, I wasn’t sure how it worked when ordering from my car. The idea of showing a QR code while sitting in the car, to a person on the speaker looked like too much effort.
Today, I finally decided to ask at the drive-thru if I could collect points. To my surprise, the staff just asked for my 4-character code from the McDonald’s app. I gave it, and—voilà!—points added.</p>

<p>As I waited for my order, I started thinking: how does this work? If they identify me with just a 4-character code, does that mean only 10,000 people can collect points (since 4 characters could mean 10,000 combinations)? That didn’t seem right.</p>
<p>Curious, I opened the app, found my code, and took a screenshot. Instantly, a pop-up appeared: “This code is valid for 2 minutes and will change if you restart the app.” Mystery solved! It’s a session code—unique, temporary, and refreshed every time you open the app. A pretty clever way to securely and smoothly collect loyalty points and identify users.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I’m no longer missing out on points! 😄</p>

<p>However, my move to Germany unveiled a unique authentication process across various applications. Whether it&rsquo;s filing taxes, accessing health insurance apps for digital health records, or managing deliveries through the DHL app, I found myself relying on codes sent to my mailbox for verification. The shift to this method has been both surprising and intriguing! 😮</p>
