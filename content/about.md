## Hello there, I'm Satyam

I'm an SRE (Site Reliability Engineer) actively shaping infrastructure at DPG Media Belgium. With nearly five years of experience, I've worked across various cloud platforms, including AWS, Azure, DigitalOcean, Hetzner, Linode, Oracle Cloud, and more. My work centers around optimizing cloud environments, crafting resilient, efficient systems, and implementing best practices in cloud technology and Linux systems.

My passion is ensuring that engineers are unblocked and can work seamlessly, regardless of the cloud environment they operate in. I'm committed to learning and adapting to new challenges, keeping pace with the ever-evolving tech landscape. I'm dedicated to sharing knowledge and helping others navigate the complexities of technology. Whether you're interested in cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes, DevOps, MLOps, or simply want to connect, don't hesitate to reach out. Let's collaborate to drive progress in the tech world.
