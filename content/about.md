## Hello there, I'm Satyam

Having recently transitioned from DPG Media in Belgium to DE-CIX in Frankfurt, Germany, I am an SRE (Site Reliability Engineer) actively involved in shaping Application platform at DE-CIX. With close to five years of experience, I have worked extensively across diverse cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, DigitalOcean, Hetzner, Linode, Oracle Cloud, and more. My focus lies in optimizing cloud environments, building resilient and efficient systems, and implementing best practices in cloud technology and Linux systems.

My dedication lies in ensuring engineers are unblocked and can operate seamlessly across various cloud environments. I am committed to continuous learning, adapting to new challenges, and staying abreast of the ever-evolving tech landscape. I am passionate about sharing knowledge and assisting others in navigating the complexities of technology. Whether you are interested in cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes, DevOps, MLOps, or simply wish to connect, feel free to reach out. Let's collaborate to drive progress in the tech realm
