## Hello there

My name is Satyam (you possibly know that from my domain). I am currently working as a Cloud Infrastructure Engineer at Sitecore. I'm mostly responsible to set up & maintain  K8s clusters, Elastic Cloud Enterprise (ECE) clusters, Observability stack (Promtheus (Thanos), Grafana, Opsgenie) in the cloud (Azure) using tools like Terraform, Helm, FluxCD, ansible etc. 

Previously I was working for Anju Software Inc. where I was responsible for setting up & maintaining k8s clusters (EKS) in AWS. I was also managing their on prem data-center (machines running ubuntu) & developing pipelines for continuos integration & deployment using Jenkins, Nexus, SonarQube & bitbucket.
